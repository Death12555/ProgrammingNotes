Certainly, here's a tabulated comparison between WiFi extenders, repeaters, boosters, amplifiers, and mesh systems based on various factors:

| Feature                              | WiFi Extender/Repeater   | WiFi Booster/Amplifier   | Mesh WiFi System                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Speed Depreciation**               | May experience speed reduction as it rebroadcasts the signal. | Amplifiers typically don't affect speed, but extenders/repeaters may. | Generally maintains better speed and performance due to the mesh architecture. |
| **Bandwidth Reduction**              | Can result in bandwidth reduction due to signal sharing and interference. | Amplifiers may not cause bandwidth reduction, but extenders/repeaters might. | Mesh systems distribute bandwidth more efficiently, minimizing reduction. |
| **Range Extension**                  | Extends the range by capturing and rebroadcasting the existing signal. | Amplifies the signal's strength, which can indirectly extend the range. | Provides seamless coverage extension with strategically placed nodes. |
| **Strength Amplification**           | Strengthens the existing signal by rebroadcasting it. | Amplifies the signal's strength. | Ensures consistent signal strength throughout the mesh network. |
| **Wired/Wireless Connectivity**      | Can have both wired and wireless connectivity options. | May have both wired and wireless options. | Typically offers both wired and wireless connectivity between nodes. |
| **Integration with Main Router**     | Operates as a separate network, may have a different SSID. | Can operate as a separate network or integrate with the main router. | Integrates seamlessly with the main router, creating a single network. |
| **Ease of Setup and Management**     | Generally easy to set up; management may vary by model. | Setup can vary; some may be plug-and-play, while others require configuration. | Mesh systems are designed for easy setup and often come with user-friendly interfaces. |
| **Consistency of Coverage**           | May result in coverage inconsistencies, especially in areas where signals overlap. | Coverage may vary based on signal strength and interference. | Provides consistent coverage with seamless roaming between nodes. |
| **Interference Issues**              | May experience interference due to the creation of a separate network. | Amplifiers may not introduce interference, but extenders/repeaters might. | Mesh systems are designed to minimize interference through intelligent channel management. |
| **Scalability**                      | Limited scalability; adding more extenders may lead to complex setups. | Limited scalability, as additional boosters may require careful placement. | Easily scalable by adding more nodes without compromising performance. |

It's important to note that individual models within each category can vary, and advancements in technology may result in new features or improvements. When choosing a solution, consider your specific needs, the size of your space, and the level of control and performance you desire.
